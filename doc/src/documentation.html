<p>Our coordinate system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right handed</a>; with the x-axis pointing
to the right, the y-axis moving away from us and the z-axis pointing up.
Rotation has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_grip_rule">right handed grip</a>, which means that
if you look from the origin of a vector the rotation is clock wise around this vector.
</p>
<p>The left-near-bottom corner of voxel space is its origin. If you designed your object with its center in the origin, you
will need to translate this object to vit inside voxel space.

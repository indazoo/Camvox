<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>This page is a short user manual. The first few chapters explain the concepts, which is followed by
some examples.
</p>
<p>You can find the documentation generated from the source code <a href="doxygen/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h1>Coordinate system</h1>
<div class="figure">
 <p><img width="250" height="191" src="images/coordsystem.gif" alt="Coordinate System"/></p>
 <p>fig: Coordinate System</p>
</div>
<p>Our coordinate system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right handed</a>; with the x-axis pointing
to the right, the y-axis moving away from us and the z-axis pointing up.
Rotation has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_grip_rule">right handed grip</a>, which means that
if you look from the origin of a vector the rotation is clock wise around this vector.
</p>
<p>The left-near-bottom corner of voxel space is its origin. If you designed your object with its center in the origin, you
will need to translate this object to vit inside voxel space.
</p>

<h1>Layers</h1>
<p>The voxel space has 8 layers, each CSG object can belong to one or more of these layers. Each layer has
a specific meaning:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Layer 1: Objects that should not be touched, like: Table, clamps, spruse and tools</li>
 <li>Layer 2: The model; when hitting this layer the tool-path should be calculated from the actual CSG model.</li>
 <li>Layer 3: The finishing layer around the model; it will be used to keep track of what parts of the model
     has been finished. During roughing this layer must be untouched.</li>
 <li>Layer 4: The material to be removed after finishing; To detach the model from the spruse.</li>
 <li>Layer 5: The material to be removed after later 6.</li>
 <li>Layer 6..29: The material to be removed at different sections.</li>
 <li>Layer 30: The first material to be removed, for example cutting of excess material before clamping the
     material securely.
</ul>

<h1>Voxel value</h1>
<p>Because memory is at a premium for voxel space a single voxel occupies 32 bits. These 32 bits have
different meanings in different contexts.

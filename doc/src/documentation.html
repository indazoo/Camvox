<p>Our coordinate system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right handed</a>; with the x-axis pointing
to the right, the y-axis moving away from us and the z-axis pointing up.
Rotation has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_grip_rule">right handed grip</a>, which means that
if you look from the origin of a vector the rotation is clock wise around this vector.
